Hi! I'm Pengfei(also go by Murphy), an undergraduate student major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor [Linguistics](https://acms.washington.edu). I am currently conducting researches at [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu) and [CLMBR](https://clmbr.shane.st). 

 

My interests lie broadly in Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently working on Emergent Communication and Scientific Relatex Extraction for biologists. I am also intereseted in commonsense reasoning, language and vision, text generation and Knowledge Base Construction. The listing is not exhaustive but I am still exploring and open to collaborate.
